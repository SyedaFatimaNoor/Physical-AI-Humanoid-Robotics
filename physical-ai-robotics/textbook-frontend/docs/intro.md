# Introduction to Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical AI and its distinction from Generative AI.
- Understand the concept of Embodied Intelligence.
- Explore the history and future of Humanoid Robotics.

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike chatbots (like ChatGPT) that process text, Physical AI agents (robots) must perceive, reason, and act in dynamic environments.

### Key Components
1. **Perception**: Sensors (Cameras, LiDAR, IMU).
2. **Reasoning**: Planning, Navigation, Decision Making.
3. **Actuation**: Motors, Servos, Hydraulics.

## Embodied Intelligence
Embodied intelligence suggests that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body and its environment. A robot's morphology (shape) influences how it learns.
