**PROMPT_TEXT**
```
not like this i want you  to run this command Step 1 — You write a spec (spec.md)

This is your master document that tells Spec-Kit what to generate.

Example of a simple spec/spec.md:

# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Spec

title: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics"
chapters:
  - name: "Introduction to Physical AI"
  - name: "Sensors & Actuators"
  - name: "Humanoid Locomotion"
  - name: "Manipulation & Grasping"
format: markdown
output_dir: "../generated-textbook"
model: "gpt-4.1"

Whenever you edit this file, Spec-Kit knows what to create.

🔹 Step 2 — You run the content generator script

Your project already includes:

textbook-frontend/scripts/generate_content.py

... (rest of user request omitted for brevity)
```

**RESPONSE_TEXT**
Acknowledged. Created `spec/spec.md` defining the textbook specification and generated a Prompt History Record (PHR) for this action.
