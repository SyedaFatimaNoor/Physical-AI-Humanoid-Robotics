**PROMPT_TEXT**
```
Update spec/spec.md to include the full "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course syllabus as chapters:
1. Introduction to Physical AI (Weeks 1-2)
2. ROS 2 Fundamentals (Weeks 3-5)
3. Robot Simulation with Gazebo (Weeks 6-7)
4. NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)
5. Humanoid Robot Development (Weeks 11-12)
6. Conversational Robotics (Week 13)
7. Capstone Project

Then refactor textbook-frontend/scripts/generate_content.py to:
1. Parse the `chapters` list dynamically from spec/spec.md (using regex or simple parsing if standard yaml lib isn't available, or installing pyyaml).
2. Generate all chapters defined in the spec.
```

**RESPONSE_TEXT**
Acknowledged. I will update `spec/spec.md` with the accurate course syllabus and refactor `generate_content.py` to drive content generation dynamically from the spec file, ensuring strict adherence to the Spec-Driven Development workflow.
